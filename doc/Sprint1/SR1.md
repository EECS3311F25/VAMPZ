## Unfinished Tasks / Stories to Move to Next Sprint

### *Unfinished Stories:*
1. **Simulated Stock Trading Feature**  
   - Implement actual buy/sell functionality using mock data.  
   - Create backend or local data handling for transactions.  
   - Display trade confirmations and update portfolio dynamically.  

2. **Portfolio Overview (Functional)**  
   - Integrate portfolio logic with backend data once created.  
   - Show updated balance, gain/loss metrics, and transaction history.  

---

### *New User Stories for Sprint 2:*
#### **User Story: Mock Trading Logic**
- *As a user*, I want to simulate buying and selling stocks using virtual currency so that I can practice real trading scenarios safely.  
- *Acceptance Criteria:*  
  - Implement local data state for transactions.  
  - Update balance and holdings automatically.  
  - Show confirmation messages for trades.

#### **User Story: Portfolio Data Visualization**
- *As a user*, I want to see charts of my virtual portfolio’s performance so that I can learn from my simulated results.  
- *Acceptance Criteria:*  
  - Display a bar/line chart using mock performance data.  
  - Highlight total profit/loss trends.

## Practices to Continue Next Sprint
- Consistent communication on GitHub and during team meetings.  
- Maintaining clean UI design and consistent color/theme throughout the app.  
- Dividing work based on individual strengths (UI, routing, writing, testing).  
- Testing and reviewing each feature before merging into main.  

---

## New Practices to Start Next Sprint
- Start implementing **backend or mock API integration** earlier in the sprint.  
- Schedule **shorter, more frequent check-ins** to track progress.  
- Use **Trello actively** to visualize tasks and ensure transparency.  
- Add basic **unit testing** for critical UI and logic components.  

---

## Practices to Stop
- Avoid leaving key setup tasks (e.g. data fetching, backend integration) for the final days.  
- Stop working individually without syncing commits regularly — merge changes more frequently.  
- Avoid over-scoping sprints with too many planned features.  

---

## Best & Worst Experiences
- **Best Experience:** Seeing the homepage, login, and dashboard come together into a cohesive design and working navigation flow. It felt rewarding to see the app become interactive.  
- **Worst Experience:** Struggling to find and afford a usable API for real market data, which delayed parts of the integration work and limited backend progress.  

---

## Summary
Sprint 1 successfully established the **foundation** for StockSprout’s front-end architecture and user experience.  
The authentication system and navigation are complete, and the team now has a clear direction for connecting the UI to mock or live market data in Sprint 2.
