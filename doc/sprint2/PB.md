# Product Backlog – Sprint 2

## Overview
In this sprint, the team focused on integrating a sample API to demonstrate the stock chart functionality. The API was tested to ensure that the graph displayed accurate and up-to-date price data. This allowed the backend functionality to be validated before shifting focus to the frontend. Key tasks completed in this phase included setting up API calls, validating response data, and rendering sample charts for testing purposes.

## Frontend Development
Following the API testing, the team shifted focus to building the **Stock Page Detail** feature on the frontend. This component provides users with a comprehensive view of a selected stock, including its current price, price changes, historical chart data, and trading options. Additional improvements include a dynamic timeframe selector, detailed price display, and interactive sub-navigation for stock-related information. Remaining tasks include refining UI interactions, integrating real-time API data, and completing the demo video for Sprint 2.
