## 5. Meeting Notes & Decisions
- **Decision:** This release is focused purely on getting the auth framework and homepage built. All other functionality is explicitly out of scope.
- **Decision:** For US001 (Registration), we will only implement duplicate email checking. Full email verification (US001.a) and password strength rules (US001.b) are de-scoped and moved to the next release to meet the deadline.
- **All participants agreed on this limited scope to establish a base for future development.**
