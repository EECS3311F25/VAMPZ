# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I reviewed the dashboard structure and began organizing the backend integration points. I also identified unnecessary features, such as TFSA holdings and other unrelated account types, which I decided to remove to simplify the system.
Made sure that the frontend is integrated well with the backend and it runs smooth.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I will start separating the major dashboard UI sections into individual component files so the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain. After that, I’ll begin implementing the initial portfolio handling logic.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect the component refactoring to be done by 11-10-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers
