# StockSprout Sprint 0 Process Reflection

## Team Organization

### Team Structure
Our team organized in a team-based, cross-functional manner where each member owns specific technical domains while being part of overarching project decisions. We had clearly defined roles based on the strength of each individual and interest:

- **Frontend Development**: User experience design and React.js
- **Backend Development**: Database design and Node.js API development
- **Java Microservices**: Analytics services and market data processing
- **DevOps & Integration**: System architecture and deployment coordination

### Tools and Communication
We selected all-in-one toolkit to support our development process:

- **Communication**: Discord server for real-time discussion and morning standups
- **Project Management**: Trello for recording user stories and sprint planning
- **Version Control**: GitHub for collaboration on code using feature branch workflow
- **Documentation**: Shared Google Drive for collaborative document editing
- **Development**: Visual Studio Code with Live Share for pair programming sessions

### Decision Making Process
We employed a consensus decision making process with formal voting as and when necessary:

1. **Proposal Phase**: Team member provides solution or idea and rationale
2. **Discussion Phase**: Open discussion of pros, cons, and alternatives (15-20 minutes)
3. **Voting Phase**: Anonymous Trello voting power-ups if consensus is not reached
4. **Documentation Phase**: Record decision and rationale in our team wiki

This workflow worked well for big architecture decisions but a bit too slow for minor implementation details.

## Priority Definition and User Story Estimation

### Prioritization Framework
We used a modified MoSCoW approach with business value scoring:

- **Must Have (P1)**: Critical functionality necessary for MVP
- **Should Have (P2)**: Features critical to user experience
- **Could Have (P3)**: Nice-to-have features that provide polish
- **Won't Have (P4)**: Features explicitly not in current scope

All user stories were also given ratings of business value (1-10) and complexity of implementation (1-10).

### Point Estimation Process
We used Planning Poker using Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation:

1. **Story Reading**: Product owner reads the user story and acceptance criteria
2. **Clarification**: Team asks questions and discusses edge cases (5-10 minutes)
3. **Individual Estimation**: Each member individually selects story points
4. **Reveal and Discuss**: Simultaneous reveal, discuss outliers (5-10 minutes)
5. **Re-estimation**: Repeat until consensus or close enough (2 points)

**Average Voting Rounds**: 2.3 rounds per user story
- CRUD operations: Usually 1-2 rounds
- Integration features: 3-4 rounds
- UI/UX dominated features: 2-3 rounds

The process took longer than expected initially but improved as the team learned their understanding of story complexity.

## Meeting Frequency and Format

### Regular Meetings
- **Daily Standups**: 15 minutes every weekday at 6:00 PM EST on Discord
  - What was done yesterday?
  - What will be done today?
  - Any blockers or impediments?

- **Sprint Planning**: 2-hour meeting at beginning of sprint
  - Discuss and get clear on product backlog
  - Select user stories for upcoming sprint
  - Break down stories into tasks and estimate effort

- **Sprint Review/Retrospective**: 1.5-hour collaborative session at sprint end
  - Demonstrate completed features
  - Discuss what has worked and how to make it better
  - Create process changes for next sprint

### Ad-Hoc Collaboration
- **Technical Spikes**: 1-2 hour focused sessions when tackling hard tech problems
- **Pair Programming**: 2-3 sessions weekly for hard features or knowledge sharing
- **Architecture Reviews**: Single weekly 1-hour session to discuss system design choices

## Challenges and Learning Points

### What Worked Well
1. **Daily Standups**: Put everyone on the same page and caught blockers early
2. **Discord Integration**: Real-time conversation reduced email overhead by a huge margin
3. **Shared Screen Sessions**: Were perfect for resolving tough problems and knowledge transfer
4. **Documentation-First Approach**: User stories and acceptance criteria documented early eliminated later ambiguity

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Estimation Accuracy**: Initial estimates were always 20-30% too rosy
2. **Technical Spike Management**: Demand better process for handling research work that does not generate user value directly
3. **Meeting Time Management**: Some meetings ran over time allocated, especially technical architecture meetings
4. **External Dependencies**: Didn't allow for time to research and incorporate third-party APIs

### Specific Lessons Learned
1. **Breaking Down User Stories**: Large stories (>8 points) always were a problem and need to be broken down further
2. **Definition of Done**: Having clear, specific criteria prevented scope creep and upheld quality
3. **Technology Learning Curve**: Java Spring Boot integration required more research time than initially expected
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Starting with mobile wireframes made responsive design much easier

## Lessons for Next Phase

### Process Improvements
1. **Add Buffer Time**: Include 15-20% buffer to all estimates for learning and integration problems
2. **Technical Debt Tracking**: Implement clear user stories for technical debt and infrastructure improvements
3. **Stakeholder check-ins**: Have weekly demo sessions with instructors/TAs for initial feedback
4. **Code Review Standards**: Have peer review compulsory for every change with review checklist documented

### Tool Enhancements
1. **Automated Testing**: Implement continuous integration pipeline to run tests automatically
2. **Code Quality Gates**: Implement SonarQube or similar tool to enforce code quality metrics
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline performance measures and monitoring dashboard
4. **Documentation Automation**: Automate API documentation using JSDoc and Swagger

### Team Dynamics
1. **Skill Sharing Sessions**: Bi-weekly 30-minute sessions in which team members will instruct one specific technology or technique
2. **Rotation Strategy**: Rotate team members across technical domains to develop cross-functional abilities
3. **External Mentorship**: Make more aggressive use of instructor and TA office hours to request technical guidance

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Technical Proof of Concepts**: Complete mini proof-of-concept builds before investing in user stories
2. **External API Contingency**: Identify backup data feeds in case primary market data APIs are not available
3. **Scope Management**: Define minimum viable features for every epic in order to ship core functionality

The team believes that these lessons and process enhancements will greatly improve our effectiveness during Sprint 1 and forward. Our teamwork and continuous improvement commitment put us in a good position to deliver successful projects.
