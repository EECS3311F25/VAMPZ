# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I started drafting the structure for the dashboard page. This included planning out the sections such as total balance, total return, buying power, portfolio performance chart, and a popular stocks section. I also created the initial wireframe layout for how the dashboard should look.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I will begin implementing the top portion of the dashboard UI, focusing on the “Hi, User” welcome header and the three metric cards (Total Balance, Total Return, Buying Power).

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
By 11-02-2025, I should have the upper half of the dashboard UI implemented.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers — just need to finalize icon choices and spacing for the component
