# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I worked on outlining the overall system design, focusing on how the controllers, services, and models will interact. I also started researching different market data APIs to determine which ones fit our project needs.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I plan to begin building the initial controllers for handling market data requests and continue comparing APIs based on speed, reliability, and free-tier limitations

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect to finish the first draft of the controllers and finalize an API choice by 11-10-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
The main challenge is determining which API gives fast-enough refresh rates while still being affordable for the team.
