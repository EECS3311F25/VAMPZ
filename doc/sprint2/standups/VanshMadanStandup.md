# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I reviewed the dashboard structure and began organizing the backend integration points. I also identified unnecessary features, such as TFSA holdings and other unrelated account types, which I decided to remove to simplify the system.
Made sure that the frontend is integrated well with the backend and it runs smooth.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I will start separating the major dashboard UI sections into individual component files so the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain. After that, I’ll begin implementing the initial portfolio handling logic.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect the component refactoring to be done by 11-10-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers

# [11-10-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 2

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I finished splitting the dashboard into modular components (balance card, return card, buying power card, performance section, etc.). This made the layout easier to integrate with backend data. I also removed outdated or irrelevant sections. I help design the graphs for the dashboard and made a use case diagram for the project.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I’ll begin connecting the backend  data to the dashboard UI and connecting portfolio to dashboard header and ensure the dashboard renders initial user portfolio values correctly.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect to have the dashboard pulling basic portfolio data by 11-15-2025.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers 

# [11-15-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 3

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I integrated the backend data for the initial portfolio into the dashboard, allowing it to display holdings, balances, and other retrieved values. I also cleaned up unused props, removed redundant UI logic, and confirmed that the dashboard loads properly with backend responses.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I will continue refining the integration, ensure all components update smoothly, and prepare the dashboard for demo showcasing.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect to complete the final adjustments by end of day, 11-17-2025.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers
