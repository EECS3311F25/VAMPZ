# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I drafted the initial UML class diagram for the system. This included identifying the main entities such as User, Portfolio, Holding, and Transaction. I also mapped out relationships and attributes needed for storing user assets and trading history.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I plan to refine the class diagram, finalize inheritance/associations, and prepare it for backend implementation. I will also begin setting up the backend project structure.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect to finalize the class diagram by 11-10-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
need to confirm how we want to store trades

# [11-10-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 2

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I completed the full class diagram, including detailed methods and finalized relationships between the backend entities. I also started implementing the backend models for Portfolio, Holdings, and Transactions based on the UML.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I’ll continue implementing the backend logic, specifically methods for adding transactions, updating holdings, and maintaining portfolio totals. I will also set up the basic data-handling functions.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I plan to finish the core backend functions by 11-15-2025.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers 

# [11-15-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 3

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I finished implementing the backend for portfolio and transaction management. This includes tracking all buys/sells, updating holdings, recalculating totals, and maintaining a clean object structure based on the class diagram. I also tested the main functions to ensure they behave as expected.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
I will clean up documentation, ensure the backend integrates smoothly with our upcoming frontend logic, and prepare materials to show this work during the sprint demo.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I should complete documentation and cleanup by 11-17-2025.

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers
