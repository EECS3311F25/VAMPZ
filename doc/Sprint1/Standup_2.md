# [11-02-2025] - Sprint 1 Standup 2

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
We implemented the homepage UI and completed the sign-up and login form designs. The routing between pages has also been set up, and both forms are now functional with validation.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
We plan to work on the dashboard page that users see after logging in, and connect the navigation flow between all pages.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
We want to be done by 11-03-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No blockers at the moment — we just need to manage our time to complete UI polish and testing before the sprint deadline.
