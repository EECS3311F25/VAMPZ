# [11-05-2025] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

## 1. What did you work on since last Standup?
I started building the core components for the stock details page. I implemented the PriceDisplay.jsx component to show the stock’s current price, daily change, and percentage change. I also created the TimeframeSelector.jsx with the 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, and 1Y buttons.

## 2. What do you commit to next?
Next, I’ll begin working on the chart section by setting up StockChart.jsx with dummy data using react-chart or a placeholder, and I’ll connect it to the selected timeframe state.

## 3. When do you think you will be done?
I expect to finish the initial chart with mock data by 11-10-2025

## 4. Do you have any blockers?
No major blockers
