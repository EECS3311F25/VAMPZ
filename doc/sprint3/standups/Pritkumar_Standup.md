### [11-24-2025] - Sprint 3 Standup 1
1. **What did you work on since last Standup?**  
   I worked on the marketing homepage. Built and styled `HERO.jsx` with headline, subheadline, and animated ticker background. Implemented reusable `CTA.jsx` (primary & secondary variants), created the `Feature.jsx` grid with icons and descriptions, and built `Pricing.jsx` with Free/Pro/Premium tiers including monthly/yearly toggle and feature comparison table.

2. **What do you commit to next?**  
   I'll start and complete the core structure of `WatchListPage.jsx` – the user's personal dashboard for managing watched stocks.

3. **When do you think you will be done?**  
   I expect to have the full WatchListPage (add/remove, drag-to-reorder, empty state, responsive layout) ready by EOD 11-25-2025.

4. **Do you have any blockers?**  
   No blockers – design system and tokens are all in place.
